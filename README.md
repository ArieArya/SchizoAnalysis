# Data Science for Schizophrenia Treatment

This project performs a thorough analysis on datasets of patients suffering from schizophrenia being treated with an experimental drug. Schizophrenia is a mental disorder whereby a person views reality abnormally, and its severity is measured by a PANSS (Positive and Negative Symptom Scale) score. The higher this score is, the more severe the case for schizophrenia is.

This project has four main sections:
- Analyzing the general efficacy of the experimental drug
- Clustering similar patient groups to see how they react to the drug
- Forecasting patient PANSS score using recurrent neural networks
- Binary classification of unreliable PANSS assessments using gradient boosting

Some of the key and important diagrams obtained from this project are shown below.
